This is my sporadically worked on attempt to write a slicer in Rust. 
Please don't judge the code quality. I basically learned Rust as I wrote it, and explored features of the language and architectural techniques as I go along. There is a vague idea now of how I'd like this to look, I'm going to go back and clean it up when I have the time.

On that note, I don't have a ton of time to work on this, hence the sporadic updates over the last few years. Blame my kids.
